I have a question about how Spidermonkey handles Javascript objects and classes. I can imagine two scenarios: Objects and classes are language abstractions that have nothing to do with how things are stored in hardware memory, exaggerated example of this would be that 100 objects of a class with 3 variables in it would be stored as 3 arrays with 100 raw values each in memory and nothing more. OR, objects and classes are stored in memory similarly to how they're described in Javascript code. Exaggerated example of this would be that the class exists somewhere in memory and its name exists in memory as a string (which would be totally unnecessary overhead), and the data is stored per object in memory with all overhead that comes with it. Which one of these is it?</td></tr>

The representation of shapes is complicated, but roughly speaking an object's shape describes the mapping between its property names and the slots in which they are stored. The slots array contains the properties of the object with a string key. The elements array stores the integer-indexed properties (eg <code>obj[10]</code>).</td></tr>

The first N properties on an object are stored as part of the object itself (fixed slots), and then subsequent properties are accessed via the slots pointer (dynamic slots).</td></tr>

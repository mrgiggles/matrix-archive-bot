I suppose I still could but was wondering if there was an annotation) </blockquote></mx-reply>Sadly, only the annotions.js one. I keep meaning to add one. I think I may have even worked on it once, only to get annoyed at old-style vs new-style attribute handling in the compilers. If it's for the individual callsites, I could always fall back on a <code>JS::MagicFunctionThatDoesntActuallyDoAnything(fptr)</code>. But that's not really much better than <code>AutoSuppressGCAnalysis</code>. It would be better to associate it with the type, and hope that people are using a consistent type (the one with the annotation) everywhere.</td></tr>

I ended up listing the specific function ptr instantiation in various templated things, and that appeared to appease the analysis. <code>AutoSuppressGCAnalsys</code> probably would have worked, but it caused circular header inclusion issues, and it wasn't immediately obvious how to deal with this in this context where ~everything is in headers because of template and/or inlining</blockquote></mx-reply>Ah, yes, I have done the same thing for the same reason.</td></tr>

I have a huuuuuge rr trace that has been replaying for 40 min now, and caused pernosco to oom.... but thus far it's my only repro) </blockquote></mx-reply>fwiw, I don't generally trust rr to not crash in the situations I really care about, and for long recordings, I'll often use <code>taskset -c ... rr replay -u ...</code> to run multiple replay attempts on different cores (it'll default to core 0, which is where the original recording ran). Then when one crashes, I'll flip to the next. In theory, rr doesn't ensure that traces are portable across cores, but I've never had a problem (and roc/khuey didn't think it was a wholly stupid thing to do, so they let me add the <code>-u</code> option).</td></tr>

This was a decade ago, so my memory is a bit sketchy, but IIRC the only solution I could find was to keep a list of the JSObject *s I created in storage pointed to by the private member of the JSContext *.  Then I would use atomic CAS operations put stuff in that list and remove it. The benefit of the CAS here is that I arranged the support code so that failure to swap wasn't a correctness problem and then I could let my threads freely race, which was important at least then in JS GC since it could be called from off-thread. In your case it might mean, for example, not needing to hold the Python GIL.  That technique I learned from Brendan's lockless property access code in (early? still current?) spidermonkey code.</p>
<p>A more direct answer to this that doesn't require book keeping is that you can know when the number of roots becomes zero by registering a JSGCCallback function that functions as an observer.  Once spidermonkey asks if you if it's okay to collect the object, you know that there are zero JS-land references to your object, and you <em>only</em> need to worry about Python references.</p>

It is not a simple task. The basic idea is that JS objects reachable from JS roots get marked black during a GC, while JS objects reachable only from C++ roots also get marked a special gray color. The cycle collector traces through JS held alive by C++ and treats non-gray objects as being definitely alive by not tracing through them.</td></tr>

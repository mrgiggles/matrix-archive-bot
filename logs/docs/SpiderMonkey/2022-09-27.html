Handle&lt;T&gt; is really just a T* that you happen to know will be visited by the GC, usually because it's the T* stored within a Rooted and thus part of a linked list of Rooteds that the GC knows to visit. Each linked list handles a single type so we can scan over it quickly without inspecting anything to figure out what type it is and therefore what its bits mean.</td></tr>

Since the finalizer gets called on the prototype as well as instances, it was the prototype that had a null private slot.</td></tr>
